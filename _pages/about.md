Hello, I am a Biostatistician in the Department of Pediatrics at Stanford Medicine, working with the Stanford Applied Medical and Bionetwork Analysis (SAMBA) Lab and the Stanford Center for Artificial Intelligence in Medicine and Imaging.

My work sits at the interface of biostatistics, clinical artificial intelligence, and longitudinal health data. I focus on methods that connect modeling, validation, and clinical decision support, especially in pediatrics.

## Research interests

1. Biostatistical and machine learning methods for longitudinal electronic health records and imaging  
2. Causal inference and robust estimation from observational clinical data  
3. Safety, calibration, and external validation for clinical decision support models

## Background

I currently work as a Biostatistician I in Pediatric Nephrology at Stanford Medicine. I collaborate with clinicians, imaging scientists, and data scientists on projects that span body composition, oncology, and cardiovascular imaging. Before Stanford, I trained in statistics and biostatistics at the University of Waterloo and the University of Michigan.

## News

- 2025: Co led analysis for a study of targeted cancer medications and kidney health, accepted in *JAMA Network Open*.  
- 2024: Presented pediatric body composition and metabolic risk work at the ASBMR Annual Meeting in Toronto.  
- 2023: Joined Stanford Pediatrics as a full time biostatistician.  

## Selected research projects

### Fat mass adjusted lean mass indices and metabolic risk in children

At Stanford, I lead analysis for a project that develops fat mass adjusted appendicular lean mass Z scores from pediatric dual energy X ray absorptiometry data and evaluates their association with metabolic syndrome markers in NHANES 2011 to 2014.

I build sex specific regression models, use age stratified analyses, and compare the performance of adjusted and unadjusted lean mass indices for prediction of metabolic risk.

### Molecularly targeted cancer medications and kidney health

I serve as a biostatistician on a study of kidney safety for targeted cancer therapies using large scale electronic health records. We construct exposure cohorts in OMOP common data model, model longitudinal creatinine based outcomes, and use time to event methods with competing risks to quantify kidney injury and recovery.

### Evaluation of coronary artery calcium AI tools

In collaboration with radiology and cardiology, I evaluate artificial intelligence tools that estimate coronary artery calcium scores on computed tomography studies. I focus on agreement with expert readers at clinical decision thresholds, subgroup performance, and calibration summaries that are useful for deployment decisions.

## Teaching, mentorship, and service

I enjoy mentoring students and early career researchers who are interested in statistics and health data science. Earlier, I volunteered as a tutor in public libraries and supported outreach activities for younger students. At Stanford, I help junior team members with reproducible analysis workflows in R, SQL, and the OMOP ecosystem.

## Outside of work

Outside research, I like bouldering, exploring coffee shops, and spending time with family and friends.
